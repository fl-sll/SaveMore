            <h2> About Us </h2>
            <p> Save More is a non government organization (NGO) that focuses on helping the victims from natural disasters that happened all across Indonesia, it was founded in January 2022 by 5 young university students who have an ambition to make the world a safer and better place supported by Binus International University. The Organization wants to make an impact by helping other people to be relieved from their burdens, losses, fear, and trauma from the natural disasters that happen and destroy their homes, places where they make a living, and things that matter to them. We aim to create a community where people have each others’ back so that people can count on each other. We also aim to make people less selfish by lending other people a lending hand. We want to make Indonesia to be seen as a lovely and solidarity nation where they would see that Indonesians would help one another when they’re in need.
